        "Have you ever wondered how we process and learn information? For example, how does our body process information such that we are able to move our hands or legs? To put it simply, the brain will process information and then send out signals to the rest of the body to trigger certain muscle movements. These signals are transported through the nervous system. One of the main components of the nervous system are neuron cells. These cells work on a threshold basis which means that the signal will only be transferred from cells to cells if it is higher than a certain value or amount. As such, when we decide to move our hands, the signals from the brain will get transferred to the muscle in our hands and not the muscle in our legs.\n",

        "### Training Artificial Neural Networks\n",
        "However, this only explains how we process information. How about the ability of humans to learn? For example, why do we know to stop at a red light or how to kick a ball? It is because we were trained to do so by looking at examples or how other people were doing it. Through these examples, we were able to learn and remember.\n",
        "\n",
        "Would it be great if computers were able to mimic the way humans process and learn information? With artificial neural network, this can be done! Artificial neural networks are able to process and 'learn' complex relationships within datasets. An illustration of a simple neural network is shown below.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea is that we input data into the input layer. Data will be processed in the subsequent hidden layer(s) - we only show one hidden layer on the picture below, but it can be many layers. Each layer is made of multiple artificial neurons which apply functions to the data and pass it on to another hidden layer, finally ending with the output layer. "

Your mother replies that the cake is too sweet and slightly burnt. Thus, you try and adjust the amount of sugar and also the time the cake spent in the oven.

Your friend wants to find the flower types for these flowers based on the values measured. Would you be able to use your model to help your friend?

Additionally, the values returned by the .predict method will be the probability of each flower type that the model thinks should be assigned to each data row. As such, the higher the probablity, the more confident the model is that the flower type predicted is correct. For example, if the predicted values are very high in the second column, then the model thinks that the flower type is versicolor. You will also need to scale your data before obtaining the flower types. </font>"

        "Congrats! You have successfully learnt how to create an artificial neural network model and trained it. Artficial neural networks are extremely powerful tools that can be used on very large datasets. For example, if you have a couple of hundred columns/features and over 100000 data points, it may be beneficial to use artificial neural networks instead of other machine learning techniques. Just remember, there are no strict rules on the number of nodes in the hidden layer or the number of hidden layers. Experiment with different neural networks to see which one provides the best result for your dataset."
