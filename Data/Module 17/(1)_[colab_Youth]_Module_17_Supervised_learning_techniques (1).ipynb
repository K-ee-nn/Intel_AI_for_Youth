One-hot encoding changes the categories into binary (0 or 1) categories. For example, if you have raining or sunny days as categories, one hot encoding will add 2 more columns, rainy and sunny, to the dataframe. If the data point shows rainy, it will be converted to a value of 1 under the raining column and a value of 0 under the sunny column (see table below). Read this [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/) to find out more about one-hot encoding.
